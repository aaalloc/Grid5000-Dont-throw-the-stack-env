# DESCRIPTION: Recipe extending a Grid'5000 environment recipe supported by
# the technical team. The build will be similar to the one of the supported
# environments, involving puppet notably.
#
#==============================================================================
# This recipe extends another. To look at the step involed, run:
#   kameleon build -d ubuntu2204-dont-throw-the-stack.yaml
# To see the variables that you can override, use the following command:
#   kameleon info ubuntu2204-dont-throw-the-stack.yaml
